        <p>TikTok, whose mainland Chinese counterpart is Douyin,[a][3] is a short-form video hosting service owned by Chinese internet company ByteDance. It hosts user-submitted videos, which can range in duration from three seconds to 60 minutes.[4] It can be accessed with a smart phone app.

            Since its launch, TikTok has become one of the world's most popular social media platforms, using recommendation algorithms to connect content creators with new audiences.[5] In April 2020, TikTok surpassed two billion mobile downloads worldwide.[6] Cloudflare ranked TikTok the most popular website of 2021, surpassing Google.[7] The popularity of TikTok has allowed viral trends in food and music to take off and increase the platform's cultural impact worldwide.[8]
    
        TikTok has come under scrutiny due to data privacy violations, mental health concerns, misinformation, offensive content, and its role during the Israel–Hamas war.[9][10] Countries have fined, banned, or attempted to restrict TikTok to protect children or out of national security concerns over possible user data collection by the Chinese government through ByteDance.[9</p>
